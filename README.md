# The Journey
This is a story of an epic journey across a desert land, with scattered mirages of hope. During the first 3 days of this journey, the travelers were weary and lost. There was no hope that their journey would take them to the promised land. The travelers were bombarded during the day with scorcing heat and deadly serpants. The scorcing heat laid waste to many travelers and brought many of them to their knees. Then on the end of the fourth day there was hope! All of the remaining travelers were joyous when they stumbled upon the mirage that they had heard about! Vast regions of water, green grass, and shade. It was like they had finally found what they had been looking for.

This last week has been the hardest week I have had in almost forever. I had a lot going on trying to grasp everything this last week that I thought I knew, but at times I did not. I also had to over come a few personal things as well over this last week and I learned a lot on how to work through things that you can't see coming. 

The whole project finally just clicked on Friday when I really understood exactly what was going on. It took a lot of asking questions and seeing examples from other classmates as well...

Anyways, this project was an idea I came up with after seeing something similar with another GA students "project"...I thought it would of been a great chance to use another API to build something that did what I thought could be done better by some other music apps. Turns out that maybe working with another API not your own is rather difficult to acheive something so simple as to what my current app does.
